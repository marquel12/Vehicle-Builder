# Vehicle-Builder

## Description 
#### This application prompts the user to either create a new vehicle or select an existing vehicle. 
#### After going through the creation or selection process, the user is able to perform certain actions with the selected vehicle. 
#### The user is returned to the actions menu after each action until they decide to exit the application.



#### Challenges as a new learner in coding: For this project I created two additional classes, Truck and Motorbike. I added a unique function for both classes. For the truck class I added a function to allow certain trucks who weigh more than cars and motorbikes to be able to tow the vehicle. For motorbikes, I added a function to allow a user to perform an action which would allow the motorbike to wheelie. This was a fun project, I got a chance to learn more about classes and how to properly use another class properties and methods. I've also learned more about the importance of calling your base class before using "this." in constructor.
